# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Introduction
This repository contains all the code and documentation for our machine learning project aimed at predicting diabetes. The project is structured to follow the main steps in a typical data science workflow:

1. **Data Analysis**: Summarizing and visualizing the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and correlations.
2. **Data Preparation**: Selecting the most relevant features, preprocessing the data, and transforming it to be fed into machine learning models.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Testing different models, exploring various algorithms, and reporting the results to identify the most accurate predictive model.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This folder contains the dataset used for model training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experiments with different models.

## Data Analysis
During the data analysis phase, we perform various tasks such as:

- Identifying missing values
- Statistical summary of different features
- Data visualization (histograms, box plots, etc.)

## Data Preparation
The data preparation phase involves:

- Data cleaning
- Feature selection
- Data transformation (normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables)

## Model Evaluation
For model evaluation, we:

- Split the data into training and test sets
- Experiment with different algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, SVM)
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
